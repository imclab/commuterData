commuterData
============

4460 info vis of commuter data by state

TODO
* Percentage vs. Absolute Value of population needed
* Linking/Brushing between VIS1 + VIS2
* Linking/Brushing within itself

Visualization #1:	Show	the	breakdown	of	commuters	by	state.	You	should	allow	the	
user	to	select	which	state	is	shown	(this	should	most	likely	be	a	dropdown	list,	but	if	you	
are ambitious	you	could	look	into	using	a	state	map	to	select	the	state	that	is	shown).	
Details	on	demand	should	pop	up	on	mouse	over.
* Dropdown completed
* Donut Chart visualized
* DoD completed

Visualization #2:	Show	the	top	3	states	for	each	category	of	commuting.	You	must	also	
provide	a	way	to	toggle	between	showing	the	top	3	by	numbers,	and	the	top	3	by	
percentages.	There	should	be	linking/brushing	within	this	visualization	(when	a	user	
mouses	over	whatever	displays	your	information,	other	displays	for	that	state	should	
highlighted	â€“ so	if	California	is	in	the	top	3	for	Driving	Alone,	and	Car	Pooling,	if	you	
mouse	over	one	of	those	sections	they	should	both	highlight).	You	should	also	have	a	
filter	in	place	to	allow	the	user	to	narrow	or	widen	the	range	for	what	it	means	to	be	the	
top	3.	For	instance,	if	looking	at	percentages	the	initial	view	could	show	0-100%,	but	the	
user	would	be	able	to	narrow	that	to	50-75%	to	see	the	top	3	within	that	range.	Details	
on	demand	should	be	present	for	this	visualization	as	well.
* Nested Squares chosen as Vis #2 format
* Top 3 states for all 6 categories needed
* Dual filter needed for population shift

Additional	linking	between	1	and	2	should	be	present so	that	if	that	state	shown	in	1	is	
also	present	in	2,	both	should	be	highlighted	when	moused	over.

To Recap
You	need	two	visualizations.
* One	to	show	break-down	by	state	(completed)
* allows the	state	to	be	selected	somehow	(completed)
* needs	to	have	details	on	demand (completed)
* One	to	show	top	3	of	each	category (completed)
* needs	to	filterable (completed)
* needs	to	be	able	to	switch	between	percentages	and	straight	numbers	
* needs	to	have	brushing	and	linking	within	itself	
* needs	to	have	details	on	demand (completed)
* Brushing/Linking	between	the	two	visualizations	is	required
